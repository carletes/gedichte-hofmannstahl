Text versions
=============

Latin-1 and UTF-8 versions are provided. I have indented all poems
with two blank characters to avoid text rewrapping.

The UTF-8 version uses the German single quote characters. Those
single quotes are the only difference between the output of 'unitame'
and the Latin-1 version.


HTML version
============

Passed through W3C's HTML and CSS validators.


For the PPVer
=============

Proofers' remarks found in the text have been handled this way:

* 010.png: No space added between -- and ,

* 018.png: Not starting a new stanza, since there's no period at the
end of the previous verse.

* 027.png: Changed leading '-' to '--' in:

  -- So ahnte mir, da ich den Traum da fand --

* 031.png: Cavicchio: http://www.zeno.org/Literatur/M/Hofmannsthal,+Hugo+von/Libretti/Ariadne+auf+Naxos/Oper

* 069.png: Not starting a new stanza: Previous verse ends with a comma.

* 070.png: Not starting a new stanza: Previous one too short.
